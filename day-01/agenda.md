## Why me?

I've been working in the software business for 15+ years

* **Consultant** - I do mobile strategy for consumer brands like CVS, Staples, Nokia, Intel. I help them make the leap from their 90s era desktop-centric systems to a more future friendly.
* **Author** - I've written three books on mobile and web development, most notably "Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" which has been translated in to 7 languages.
* **Developer** - I do a few dev projects every year to make sure my consulting advice stays fresh. Most recently I did the javascript for responsive redesigns of EW, Techcrunch, and some parts of Time Inc. In the fall of 2014, co-developed a Rails app called Castbacker which is a crowdfunding platform for podcasters.
* **CTO** - CTO of a bootstrapped SaaS startup called StickyAlbums that helps photographers market themselves with responsive HTML5 web apps.
* **Speaker** - I've spoken at over one hundred live events on three continents (e.g., SXSW, Adobe MAX, OSCON, etc).
* **Coach** - Business coaching for software developers to help them attract bigger clients, increase their profits, create recurring revenue, etc.

## React is different

* Eschews "Write Once, Run Everywhere"
    * Learn Once, Write Everywhere
* Eschews MVC
    * Sure, MVC saved us from spaghetti code but...
    * MVC separation of concerns is arbitrary
    * React separation of concerns is more realistic
* Optimized for developer delight
* Optimized for clarity, which is important because...
    * Large teams
    * Good xplat testing is virtually impossible
